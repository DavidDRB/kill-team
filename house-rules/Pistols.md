# New Pistol Mechanics

## Rationale:
Pistols have limited use in kill-team currently. There are several factions that could gain interesting utility and gameplay options
if the mechanics for these weapons were revised. 40k has a shooting phase followed by a charge phase -- this leads to the ability to
shoot and charge in interesting ways. Kill-team has a different phase structure, but some of this funtionality can be baked into kill-team
in order to enhance combat choice and loadout options.

## Current Pistol Limitations:
* Cannot be used if charging or charged (exception: overwatch)
* Can only be used in protracted combat (lasting more than one round -- this tends to be rare given high quality weapons for cheap in most
factions

## Proposed Rulings:
* Allow Pistols to be fired at any [charge target] when charge is declared, but after charge reactions (overwatch and retreat). 
Shot is taken at -1 BS (in addition to any normal long range or obscured conditions)
* LOS and Weapon Range must be valid
* Leave protracted Pistol usage as is
* Leave Pistol functionality when your model is the target of a charge (overwatch reaction capabilities only, no shooting in following
phase)

## Things to watch in testing:
* Adeptus Astartes gain a unique "identity" as they have diverse pistol options. This could be their "thing"
* Pistols allow for a pre-psyker shot -- this may be too powerful -- testing required. The cool thing is that Pistols max at 12"
(aka charge range) -- whereas Psyker Psybolt is 18". I suspect this will lead to some realy cool positional play
* Drukhari take on interesting elements as they have a couple of cool pistols to bring to bear
* Asuryani can also lean on pistol usage -- might lead to new angles considering the subfactions for Shuriken weapon play
* Harlequins are particularly effected. I think this helps bump them up a tier and makes them insanely dangerous at close range.
It's of note that they only have the neuro disruptor pistol to use at longer range charges -- and not beyond 12". I think there could
be some really cool play considering their tactic shinanegans and fusion pistols once they close the gap. Leaving combat and recharging
a couple of models and shooting fusion or neuro disruption could lead to some really insane plays against hoards and elites.
* Tau actually gains a really cool ability on their Breachers (unplayed unit). Not sure if it will break the Rail rifle meta... but it
would offer a pretty decent pistol to an unused unit. Might make Breachers playable.
